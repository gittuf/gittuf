gittuf is a security layer for Git repositories. With gittuf, any developer who
can pull from a Git repository can independently verify that the repository's
security policies were followed. gittuf's policy, inspired by [The Update
Framework (TUF)], handles key management for all trusted developers in a
repository, allows for setting permissions for repository branches, tags, files,
etc., protects against [other attacks] Git is vulnerable to, and more â€” all
while being backwards compatible with GitHub, GitLab, etc.

gittuf is a sandbox project at the [Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)]
as part of the [Supply Chain Integrity Working Group].

## Current Status

gittuf is currently in alpha. gittuf's metadata may have breaking changes,
meaning a repository's gittuf policy may have to be reinitialized from time to
time. As such, gittuf is currently not intended to be the primary mechanism for
enforcing a repository's security.

That said, we're actively seeking feedback from users. Take a look at the [get
started guide] to learn how to install and try gittuf out! Additionally,
contributions are welcome, please refer to the [contributing guide], our
[roadmap], and the issue tracker for ways to get involved.
