# Contributing Guide

Contributions to gittuf can be of several types:
* changes to the design documents stored in the `docs/` folder
* code changes for bug fixes, new features, documentation, and other
  enhancements to the implementation
* new issues or feature requests

You can also join our community in #gittuf in [OpenSSF Slack](https://openssf.slack.com/) and/or our monthly gittuf Community Meetings, which take place the first Friday of the month at 17:00 UTC ([your timezone](https://time.is/1700_UTC)). Here are the prior [meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tXFCVUHsICLpLKxcGvhzBDUWmpsY1LQvysFaX6AJRkk/edit#heading=h.9m0zi4b0wnne) to get oriented.

## Contributor Workflow

When submitting changes to the gittuf docs or implementation, contributors must
open a GitHub pull request to the repository. gittuf uses the NYU Secure
Systems Lab
[development workflow](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/lab-guidelines/blob/master/dev-workflow.md).
Pull requests must include tests for the changes in behavior they introduce.
They are reviewed by one or more [maintainers](MAINTAINERS.txt) and undergo
automated testing such as (but not limited to):
* Unit and build testing
* Static analysis using linters
* Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) check

In future, as gittuf matures, this repository will also be secured using gittuf.
At that point, the contributor workflow may evolve to record gittuf specific
information.

## Other Guidelines

Contributors to gittuf must abide by the project's
[code of conduct](https://github.com/gittuf/community/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).
