## Contributor Workflow

When submitting changes to the gittuf docs or implementation, contributors must
open a GitHub pull request to the repository. gittuf uses the NYU Secure
Systems Lab
[development workflow](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/lab-guidelines/blob/master/dev-workflow.md).
Pull requests must include tests for the changes in behavior they introduce.
They are reviewed by one or more [maintainers](MAINTAINERS.txt) and undergo
automated testing such as (but not limited to):
* Unit and build testing
* Static analysis using linters
* Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) check

In future, as gittuf matures, this repository will also be secured using gittuf.
At that point, the contributor workflow may evolve to record gittuf specific
information.
