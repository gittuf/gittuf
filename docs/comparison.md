# Comparison: gittuf vs Guix vs sequoia-git

This document compares gittuf with other systems that integrate trust, signing, and verification into Git-based workflows.  
The criteria below are directly based on [gittuf’s stated goals](https://gittuf.dev/goals.html).

## 📊 Comparison: Independent Policy Verification

| Feature | gittuf | Guix | sequoia-git |
|--------|:------:|:----:|:-----------:|
| Enables verification independent of SCP | ✅ Policies & signatures stored in repo, verifiable by anyone with read access | ✅ Package reproducibility can be independently verified | ⚠️ Focuses mainly on commit signing; policy verification is limited |
| Uses cryptographic signatures for commits/policies | ✅ Uses public key cryptography | ✅ Uses cryptographic hashes for reproducibility | ✅ Commit signing via OpenPGP |
| Designed to prevent bypass if SCP is compromised | ✅ Metadata & policies in repo, SCP compromise doesn't break verification | ⚠️ Less direct; relies on reproducibility | ⚠️ Relies on SCP for policies; focuses mainly on signatures |

## 🛡️ Comparison: Guardrails & Logs

| Feature | gittuf | Guix | sequoia-git |
|--------|:------:|:----:|:-----------:|
| Guardrails on who can update policies | ✅ Policy can require multiple approvals & use delegations | ⚠️ Maintainers control package definitions; no enforced multi-approval | ⚠️ No built-in guardrails beyond commit signing |
| Append-only repository activity log | ✅ Append-only log synchronized across clones | ⚠️ Logs are outside core model | ⚠️ Logs rely on SCP or external tools |
| Mitigates single point of failure | ✅ Requires multiple maintainers for policy changes | ⚠️ Maintainers still have direct control | ⚠️ Single signer/maintainer can override |

## ⚙️ Comparison: System Compatibility & Metadata

| Feature | gittuf | Guix | sequoia-git |
|--------|:------:|:----:|:-----------:|
| Works with existing Git repos | ✅ Compatible with native Git objects & refs | ⚠️ Separate from Git; manages packages & builds | ✅ Extends Git via OpenPGP |
| Compatible with popular tools (GitHub, GitLab) | ✅ SCP-agnostic; works alongside popular Git hosts | ⚠️ Not built for standard Git workflows | ✅ Works alongside existing platforms |
| Supports multiple signing mechanisms | ✅ GPG, SSH, Sigstore | ✅ GPG | ✅ OpenPGP |
