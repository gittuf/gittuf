# Get Started

This guide presents a quick primer to using gittuf. Note that gittuf is
currently in alpha, and it is not intended for use in a production repository.

## Install gittuf

> [!NOTE]
> Please use release v0.1.0 or higher, as prior releases were created to
> test the release workflow.

**Pre-built binaries.** This repository provides pre-built binaries that are
signed and published using [GoReleaser]. The signature for these binaries are
generated using [Sigstore], using the release workflow's identity. Make sure you
have [cosign] installed on your system, then you will be able to securely
download and verify the gittuf release:

> [!NOTE]
> For `windows` make sure to consider the `.exe` extension, for the binary,
> signature and certificate file. Similarly, `sudo install` and the destination
> path must be modified as well.

```sh
# Modify these values as necessary.
# One of: amd64, arm64
ARCH=amd64
# One of: linux, darwin, freebsd
OS=linux
# See https://github.com/gittuf/gittuf/releases for the latest version
VERSION=0.2.0
cd $(mktemp -d)

curl -LO https://github.com/gittuf/gittuf/releases/download/v${VERSION}/gittuf_${VERSION}_${OS}_${ARCH}
curl -LO https://github.com/gittuf/gittuf/releases/download/v${VERSION}/gittuf_${VERSION}_${OS}_${ARCH}.sig
curl -LO https://github.com/gittuf/gittuf/releases/download/v${VERSION}/gittuf_${VERSION}_${OS}_${ARCH}.pem

cosign verify-blob \
    --certificate gittuf_${VERSION}_${OS}_${ARCH}.pem \
    --signature gittuf_${VERSION}_${OS}_${ARCH}.sig \
    --certificate-identity https://github.com/gittuf/gittuf/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/v${VERSION} \
    --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
    gittuf_${VERSION}_${OS}_${ARCH}

sudo install gittuf_${VERSION}_${OS}_${ARCH} /usr/local/bin/gittuf
cd -
gittuf version
```

**Building from source.** To build from source, clone the repository and run
`make`. This will also run the test suite prior to installing gittuf. Note that
Go 1.21 or higher is necessary to build gittuf.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gittuf/gittuf
$ cd gittuf
$ make
```

## Create keys

First, create some keys that are used for the gittuf root of trust, policies, as
well as for commits created while following this guide.  Note that for on-disk
keys, gittuf does not currently support encrypted private keys (see [#276]). If
the key is created using `ssh-keygen`, convert the public key format.

```bash
$ mkdir gittuf-get-started && cd gittuf-get-started
$ mkdir keys && cd keys
$ ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -f root
$ ssh-keygen -f root.pub -e -m pem > root.pem
$ ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -f policy
$ ssh-keygen -f policy.pub -e -m pem > policy.pem
$ ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -f developer
$ ssh-keygen -f developer.pub -e -m pem > developer.pem
```

## Create a Git repository

gittuf can be used with either a brand new repository or with an existing
repository. Here, we assume gittuf is being deployed with a fresh repository.
Initialize the repository and gittuf's root of trust metadata using the
key.

```bash
$ cd .. && mkdir repo && cd repo
$ git init -b main
$ git config --local gpg.format ssh
$ git config --local user.signingkey ../keys/developer
```

## Initialize gittuf

Initialize gittuf's root of trust metadata.

```bash
$ gittuf trust init -k ../keys/root
```

After that, add a key for the primary policy. gittuf allows users to specify
rules in one or more policy files. The primary policy file (called `targets`,
from TUF) must be signed by keys specified in the root of trust.

```bash
$ gittuf trust add-policy-key -k ../keys/root --policy-key ../keys/policy.pem
$ gittuf policy init -k ../keys/policy --policy-name targets
```
Then, use the policy key to initialize a policy and add a rule protecting the
`main` branch.

```bash
$ gittuf policy add-rule -k ../keys/policy --rule-name protect-main --rule-pattern git:refs/heads/main --authorize-key ../keys/developer.pem
```

Note that `--authorize-key` can also be used to specify a GPG key or a
[Sigstore] identity for use with [gitsign]. However, we're using SSH keys
throughout in this guide, as gittuf policy metadata currently cannot be signed
using GPG and Sigstore (see [#229]).

## Making repository changes

You can make changes in the repository using standard Git workflows. However,
changes to Git references (i.e., branches and tags) must be recorded in gittuf's
reference state log (RSL). Currently, this must be executed manually or using a
pre-push hook (see `gittuf add-hook -h` for more information about adding the
hook and [#220] for planned gittuf and Git command compatibility).

```bash
$ echo "Hello, world!" > README.md
$ git add . && git commit -S -m "Initial commit"
$ gittuf rsl record main
```

## Verifying policy

gittuf allows for verifying rules for Git references and files.

```bash
$ gittuf verify-ref main
```

You can also verify the signature on the commit is from a key recorded in gittuf
policy.

```bash
$ gittuf verify-commit HEAD
```

## Conclusion

This is a very quick primer to gittuf! Please take a look at gittuf's [CLI docs]
